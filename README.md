<h2><b>How do I approach designing software?</b></h2>
<h3>What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?</h3>
The design skills that I learned was how mathematically a 3D scene is created. In the past I only worked with just saying where and how large I wanted the object but never looked into the math required to create the shape.
<h3>What design process did you follow for your project work?</h3>
The design process that I followed in my project was to take each object one at a time. When working on each object, I broke them down into separate parts based on what primitive shape I could make them out of.
<h3>How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?</h3>
The tactics used in my design approach is a great way to look at any future work. When breaking down a large task into the smallest parts possible, it gives you easier achievable goals and makes finishing the project easier.

<h2><b>How do I approach developing programs?</b></h2>
<h3>What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?</h3>
A new development strategy that I used while working on my 3D scene was to look at every object together and determine what objects could be created out of the same primitive shape as each other. Normally I would have just looked at each object separetly, but as the code got more complex, looking at all the objects together allowed for easier development of similar shapes.
<h3>How did iteration factor into your development?</h3>
Iteration factored into my development when each new topic was introduced. Throughout the project development, I kept creating as many objects as I could using the knowledge taught to that point. This caused me to have to go back and rewrite larger sections of code since the new topics caused changes into how the meshes were created.
<h3>How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?</h3>
My approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones from how I was creating each of the primitive shapes. At first I was creating a different function for each part of the objects. As the code for each of the objects got more complex and as I reached a larger number of objects in the scene, I knew I would need to rewrite the functions to be more generic and be able to be used for all the shapes of the same type.

<h2><b>How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?</b></h2>
<h3>How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?</h3>
<h3>How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?</h3>
Knowledge of computational graphics and visualizations will help me in my future educational and professional pathways by giving me the knowledge of how 3D shapes are mathematically designed. This knowledge will help when tyring to create 3D applications by assiting with how to lay out and create complex shapes for the scene.
